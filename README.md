# Horse_Races

STORIES
============
• Each horse has 3 stats: speed, strength, endurance

• Each stat ranges from 0.0 to 10.0

• A horse's speed is their base speed (5 m/s) + their speed stat (in m/s)

• Endurance represents how many hundreds of meters they can run at their best speed, before the weight of the jockey slows them down

• A jockey slows the horse down by 5 m/s, but this effect is reduced by the horse's strength * 8 as a percentage

• Each race is run by 8 randomly generated horses, over 1500m

• Up to 3 races are allowed at the same time

TODO
============
There must be a webpage that include:
• A "create race" button which generates a new race of 8 random horses

• A button "progress" which advances all races by 10 "seconds" until all horses in the race have completed 1500m

• Any currently running races, showing distance covered, horse position, current time

• The last 5 race results (top 3 positions and times to complete 1500m)

• The best ever time, and the stats of the horse that generated it
